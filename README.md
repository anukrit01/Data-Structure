# Data-Structure & Algorithms
Different data structures and algorithms like linked list, stack, queue, sorting implemented using python. And more of that some practice codes related to these data structures and algorithms.
NOTE: These data structures are simply written in python, any kind of correction, efficiency improvements are humbly invited. I am right now at a learning phase so these repositories are open for all to contribute if one want to. I will definitely learn from them.
THANK YOU!!
